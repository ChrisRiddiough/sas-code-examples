- Individual programs can be viewed and copied in GitHub. The code can be pasted and executed in your SAS execution environment.  
- The full repository can be downloaded. In the main repository page, select **Code** > **Download ZIP** to download all files to your local machine, then upload to your SAS environment. 
- SAS applications that support Git integration can clone the repository to access all programs. See the following documentation references:

### Navigating the Repository
Sample programs are organized into folders by Syntax or Topic. Each sample program also includes in the initial comment block a list of keywords describing both syntax and topic. You can use the search feature in GitHub or your SAS application to search for programs based on keywords. See [KEYWORDS.txt](KEYWORDS.txt) for a list of valid keywords.  

### Troubleshooting
If there are errors in any of the programs, you may provide feedback by selecting **Issues** > **New issue** in GitHub.
